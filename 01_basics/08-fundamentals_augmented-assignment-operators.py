###################   AUGMENTED ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS  ###################

## Exercise: https://repl.it/@aneagoie/Augmented-Assignment-Operator

# Those operators have the capacities to modify a value stored 
# in the variable
# This is caracterized by another operator before the equal operator
print('\nAUGMENTED ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS:\n  Adding a mathematical symbol before or after the equal symbol')

my_number = 3
print('\n - "my_number" inition value:', my_number) # 3

# Augmented assignment: addition
my_number += 2
print('\n - "my_number += 2" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 5


# Augmented assignment: soustraction
my_number -= 4
print('\n - "my_number -= 4" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 1


# Augmented assignment: multiplication
my_number *= 25
print('\n - "my_number *= 5" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 25


# Augmented assignment: division
my_number /= 5
print('\n - "my_number /= 5" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 5.0


# Augmented assignment: power
my_number **= 2
print('\n - "my_number **= 2" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 25.0


# Augmented assignment: double divides ( rounding down to the bellow integer )
my_number //= 2
print('\n - "my_number //= 2" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 12



# Augmented assignment: modulo or remainder
my_number %= 2
print('\n - "my_number %= 2" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 0.0


# Augmented assignment: modulo or remainder
my_number %= 2
print('\n - "my_number %= 2" applied to "my_number":', my_number) # 0.0
