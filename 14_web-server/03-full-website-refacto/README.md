## HOW TO RUN THIS FOLDER
### FOLDER 03-full-website-refacto
- Set the terminal's location: `cd 14_web-server/03-full-website-refacto`
- Run flask router/server: 
	- if the main script is called `app.py`: `flask run` ( this is the case )
	- if the main script is called `<smth>.py`: 
		- in your terminal set a global variable for Flask to read the correct file:
		`FLASK_APP=<filename>.py`
		- then run `flask run`
- If .txt or .csv files are present and want to witness the creation of them - remove them  
âœ… The code supports the file creation when a mail would have been sent through the website
( Those files are mimicking a database storage / here it allows to not loose emails sent )
- Otherwise any email sent would be aggregated to the files ( both .txt and .csv files )

### EXTRA NOTES:
This folder is a refacto from the previous folder 02-full-website
Personal Objective:
- apply SOC ( Separation Of Concern ) principle
- apply abstraction principle
- experience a realistic development experience:
	- importing modules,
	- being able to handle settings a server from another file
	- cleaning the code, its organization and entry point file
	( to sum the main program )
