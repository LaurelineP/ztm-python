# REPLIT
Replit is an interface running a rep with basics environment needs.
This meeans this has the back environment of programming languages to  
kick start some course straight away.  
( includes interpreters, compiler, the language itself )
However this is not the same as running in into one's own environment  
as we do not have access that freely to the terminal  

Ex: command to run a file
`python <path-file>.py`
The environment mainly runs main.py  no other paths unless we provide config.
```sh
run="python 01_basics/01-fundamentals_discovering-python.py"
run="python 01_basics/02-fundamentals_data-types-number.py"
run="python 01_basics/03-fundamentals_math-functions.py"
run="python 01_basics/04-fundamentals_operator-precedence.py"
```



## Configure Replit
### Enabling Replit to run a specific page
- .replit file: either you replace run command opening by default a path

  WARNING: the .replit file approach does not last between session which mean each time you have to instruct replit to run the updated command
- either you import your code to run with main ( mentioned in above URL )


# DEVELOPER FUNDAMENTALS
Don't read the dictionary: Do not read and learn everything about a  
programming languages: know only what exists in order to get back to it  
instead of memorizing it


# INDENTATION IN PYTHON
Identation and spaces are important with Python turning it mandatory
whereas in other languages it is not and is mainly relate to enhance
code readability
The Python interpretor considers spaces ( space or tab ) with meanings
to interprete the code
